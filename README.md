For this project I was inspired by atronomy and its astrological significance.Initially I had no clue what the outcome
would look like but I realized that I really wanted to emphasise my astrological sign, the Taurus. I wanted to express
the traits that make Taurus a Taurus. So I tried to protray relabile, practical, and ambitious.
