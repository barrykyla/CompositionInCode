For this project I was inspired by atronomy and its astrological significance in life. Initially I had no clue what the outcomewould look like but I realized that I really wanted to emphasise my astrological sign, the Taurus. I wanted to 
express the traits that make Taurus a Taurus. So I tried to protray relabile, practical, and ambitious.
